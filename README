MKDoc::ECommerce

MKDoc is a content management system specialising in accessibility,
usability and open standards.

MKDoc-1.6 contains a fully functional shopping cart with online
payment hooks.  For MKDoc-1.8, this was removed as part of the
modularisation effort, this module contains the files that were
removed.

Some work may or may not be required to reintegrate this module with
MKDoc-1.8.

If you have any questions, suggestions or fixes - or just want to
know the current status of this module, please contact the mkdoc-dev
mailing list:
